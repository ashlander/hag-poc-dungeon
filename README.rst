Description
===========

**Dungeon of Fears** is POC (proof-of-concept) game for HaG framework - Yarn Spinner based scripts with some extra (unfortunately incompatible with official YS) flavor. Scripts are transpiled into C++ code and binaries produced, which represent server-side web game.

Turn based movement and battles with some events as visual novel are planned.
